Let's review them:\n- passing it as a parameter\n- retrieving it because it was kept\n- initializing it with init\n- setting it as a default\n- lifting the variable\n\nNow say that we put more than one of these strategies into action at the same place. Which will prevail? Actually, there is a strict order of operations:\n\n- When the function is called:\na) If a local variable receives a value as a function parameter, it will override everything else.\nb) If the value of a local variable was kept at the previous run of the function, and the same variable hasn't receive a new value passed as a parameter, then the kept value is retrieved.\nc) If, after all this, the variable doesn't have a value yet, its default (if any) is evaluated and assigned to it. If not, null is assigned-\n\n- During the actual evaluation of the function: if an init assignment is encountered, it checks whether the variable was kept: if it was, the init assignment is not performed, and it returns the current value of the variable; if it wasn't, the init assignment is performed and its value is returned. Notice that the init assignment can be performed even if the variable has a value assigned, as long as there was no value kept. For this reason, it is generally a good idea putting all the init assignments at the beginning of the function, or anyway before the first usage of their variables.\n\n- Lifted variables don't belong to the function where they appear, but to the function from which they have been lifted. So, nothing happens to them when the function is called. The behavior is exactly the same, anyway, with init assignment. Generally speaking, lifted variables should not be initialized or kept, but this is not explicitly prevented for consistency.",
