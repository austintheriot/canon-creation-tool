# canon-creation-tool
Canon Creation Tool is an application built in Max 8 to assist with the creation of musical "canons" or "rounds." These compositions, in which one voice follows the other in exact imitation, are notoriously difficult for composers to compose and plan. This application eases the difficulty of that process by altering every voice (up to 16 voices at a time) in real time as the original voice is altered. It also provides baked-in musical transformations such as retrograde, inversion, pitch shift, time stretch, etc. 

This project relies on the Max 8 runtime environment, which can be run (but not edited) free of charge. Download at https://cycling74.com/downloads
